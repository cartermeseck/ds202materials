## Outline

- Pair up and find your team member
- Create a repository (one per team) & give access to your teammate
- Do a data exploration (on chocolate ratings)
- Create R markdown files that contain code to read the data and create the plots
- Submit!


# Pair up and find your team member

## Background

Brady Brelinski, Founding Member of the Manhattan Chocolate Society, obviously likes chocolate. He has assembled a database of ratings for plain dark chocolate bars: [Flavors of chocolate](http://flavorsofcacao.com/chocolate_database.html)

By now, over 1900 different chocolate bars have been rated. 

## Meaning of ratings

Flavors of Cacao Rating System:

- 5= Elite (Transcending beyond the ordinary limits)
- 4= Premium (Superior flavor development, character and style)
- 3= Satisfactory (3.0) to praiseworthy (3.75) (well made with special qualities)
- 2= Disappointing (Passable but contains at least one significant flaw)
- 1= Unpleasant (mostly unpalatable)




## Reading the data

The file `choco.csv` at https://xdaiisu.github.io/ds202materials/hwlabs/data/choco.csv is a web scrap from the chocolate flavor data base.

You can load the data into your session using the command below:

```{r}
choco <- read.csv("https://xdaiisu.github.io/ds202materials/hwlabs/data/choco.csv")
head(choco)
```

# A data exploration

## Question set (Individual)

Coordinate with your teammate and decide among you who is Individual 1 and who is Individual 2. You should create an RMarkdown file named either `individual1.Rmd` or `individual2.Rmd` accordingly to include the answers.
Answer the following questions individually in your own file. Provide at least one graph as a basis for your answer.

1. How are the ratings distributed? Draw a histogram of the ratings and describe it. Don't forget to mention outliers, if there are any.
1. Do ratings depend on the cacao percentage of a chocolate bar? 

## Collaborating on a GitHub repository

**Individual 1:**

1. Log into github, and create a repository called `ds202_lab2`
2. Go into the settings of the repository and add your team member as a collaborator
3. Push `individual1.Rmd` and `individual1.html` to the remote.

When the above is finished, **Individual 2:**

1. Log into your email provider, and accept the invitation to the GitHub repo.
1. Clone the remote repo of Individual 1's.
2. Add `individual2.Rmd` and `individual2.html` to the local repo, and push.

## What did you do in Lab 1 and how this time is different?

(Scribble)

## Question set (team)

Discuss how to approach the following questions with your teammate. You can write your preliminary exploration into your own `individual_.Rmd` file. When finished, both teammate should collaborate on a single `team.Rmd` file which include the answers to the following questions. 

1. What is the overall number of chocolate bars rated?
2. How does the number of ratings depend on the year? Draw a bar chart of the number of reports.
3. Which are the three locations with the most ratings? How do ratings compare across these company locations?

## Question set (team) cont

4\. Brainstorm and write down an interesting question that can be answer from the dataset. The question should not duplicate the questions above.

5\. Answer the question from the dataset.

6\. Write one paragraph commenting on the workflow.

## Tips:
- You can start from Invididual 1 adding and pushing `team.Rmd`, and then Individual 2 `git pull`
- Before you make changes to existing files or `git push`, remember to `git pull` first
- Coorindate with your teammate to avoid merge conflict
- Make sure both teammates have modified `team.Rmd` file! Users who have modified this file can be viewed by issuing `git log team.Rmd` in the Terminal.

## Submission

- Due date: You have time until Wednesday Feb 12 before class to submit the final files. To submit, only the owner of the GitHub repo should email his/her username the repo name (should be `ds202_lab2`) to the TA, An Nguyen <atn@iastate.edu>.
