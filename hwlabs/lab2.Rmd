## Outline

- Pair up with a partner in your study group
- Create a repository (one per team) & give access to your teammate
- Explore data on chocolate ratings
- Create R markdown files that contain code to read the data and create the plots
- Submit!


## Background

Brady Brelinski, Founding Member of the Manhattan Chocolate Society, obviously likes chocolate. He has assembled a database of ratings for plain dark chocolate bars: [Flavors of chocolate](http://flavorsofcacao.com/chocolate_database.html). 
By now, over 2300 different chocolate bars have been rated. 

### Meaning of ratings

Flavors of Cacao Rating System:

- 5 = Elite (Transcending beyond the ordinary limits)
- 4 = Premium (Superior flavor development, character and style)
- 3 = Satisfactory (3.0) to praiseworthy (3.75) (well made with special qualities)
- 2 = Disappointing (Passable but contains at least one significant flaw)
- 1 = Unpleasant (mostly unpalatable)




### Reading the data

The file `choco.csv` at https://xdaiisu.github.io/ds202materials/hwlabs/data/choco.csv is a web scrap from the chocolate flavor data base.

You can load the data into your session using the command below:

```{r}
choco <- read.csv("https://xdaiisu.github.io/ds202materials/hwlabs/data/choco.csv")
str(choco)
```

## Searching for the Best Chocolates

## Question set (team)

1. How are the ratings distributed? Draw a histogram of the ratings and describe it. Don't forget to mention outliers, if there are any.
1. Do ratings depend on the cacao percentage of a chocolate bar? 


Discuss how to approach the following questions with your teammate. You can write your preliminary exploration into your own `individual_.Rmd` file. When finished, both teammate should collaborate on a single `team.Rmd` file which include the answers to the following questions. 

1. What is the overall number of chocolate bars rated?
2. How does the number of ratings depend on the year? Draw a bar chart of the number of reports.
3. Which are the three locations with the most ratings? How do ratings compare across these company locations?

## Question set (team) cont

4\. Brainstorm and write down an interesting question that can be answer from the dataset. The question should not duplicate the questions above.

5\. Answer the question from the dataset.

6\. Write one paragraph commenting on the workflow.

## Collaboration Workflow

### Overview
1. Discuss with your teammate plans for the analyses.
1. Coordinate with your teammate and decide among you who is Individual 1 and Individual 2. Accordingly, create an RMarkdown file named `individual1.Rmd` or `individual2.Rmd` to include your own exploration of the dataset.
2. When you and your teammate are done with your own exploration and analysis, collaborate on a `team.Rmd` file which includes the final analysis. 

### Recap: Collaborating on a GitHub repository

**Individual 1:**

1. Log into github, and create a repository called `ds202_lab2`
2. Go into the settings of the repository and add your team member as a collaborator
3. Push `individual1.Rmd` and `individual1.html` to the remote.

When the above is finished, **Individual 2:**

1. Log into GitHub and accept the invitation to work on the team repo.
1. Clone the remote repo of Individual 1's.
2. Add `individual2.Rmd` and `individual2.html` to the local repo, and push.

### Working on the `team.Rmd`
1. One of the teammates will make a draft `team.Rmd`, include the file in a git commit, and then push to the remote. 
2. The other teammate will pull, make additions and modifications to `team.Rmd`, create a commit, and then push.
3. Repeat as necessary. 



### Tips:
- You can start from Invididual 1 adding and pushing `team.Rmd`, and then Individual 2 `git pull`
- Before you make changes to existing files or `git push`, remember to `git pull` first
- Coorindate with your teammate to avoid merge conflict
- All three files `individual1.Rmd`, `individual2.Rmd`, `team.Rmd` and their knitted html files are required. Both teammates must modify `team.Rmd` (check this is done using `git log team.Rmd` in `bash`).
